## Hello! I'm Nora. 

I used to work in the nonprofit world focusing on education, gender, reproductive rights, and community building. Though I was fulfilled by the mission and environment surrounding me, I knew there was something missing when it came to the role I was playing on my teams. I started to pick up some basic web skills, and by the time I dipped my toes into JavaScript, I couldn't stop. Things just clicked.

From that point on, it was full steam ahead. I attended a coding bootcamp and dove into the world of UX and Design Systems. The most exciting part of this work is the opportunity to create pleasant experiences for all users, regardless of how they interact with their computers. Web accessibility isn't taught in bootcamp. Being able to not only build accessible components and UIs, but also teach others about the importance of accessibility, brings me joy.

I like to work on high-performing teams with people who care about each other. Outside of work, I'm an avid skier, traveler, home cook, climber, white water kayaker, and caretaker of my sweet dog, Willa.
